## Notes

* Partitioned (Discriminator) Data is supported only from Hibernate 6.x and Spring boot 3.x, each discriminator is annotated with `@Tenant` which will be added to the where clause automatically using TenantIdentifier Resolver. `TenantIdentifierResolver.resolveCurrentTenantIdentifier()` is called while creating the Hibernate session, so the tenant should be set because it is called. To set tenant we are using `TenantInterceptor` to fetch the tenant from request and set to `TenantIdentifierResolver.setCurrentTenant()` for resolving the value
* The moment a new tenant is identified Hibernate Sequence Generator will increment its value by 50, refer `ApplicationIntegrationTest` class `testSequenceCollision` Junit
