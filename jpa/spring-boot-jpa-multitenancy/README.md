## MultiTenancy using Hibernate in Spring Data JPA

 - MultiTenancy is a feature of JPA that allows you to store database data across multiple tenants. It's not a new conceptâ€”many applications have used it for years to separate data by tenant. However, Spring Data JPA provides an easy way to use multi-tenancy in your application by using Hibernate as your persistence provider.

 - This allows you to create a single entity class that can be shared by multiple tenants, giving each tenant its own independent instance of the data.

Lets see how it works by using three different approaches:

 > Partition tables by tenant id.  ->  Single table having partition (Supported Only from Hibernate 6)

 > Use a separate schema per tenant. -> Single Database having multiple schemas

 > Use a separate database per tenant. -> Different Databases having same schema (Could be having different aws regions)
