# Java Persistence API (JPA)

Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. It provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) facility for the Java language, allowing developers to interact with databases through the use of Java objects. JPA allows developers to easily persist and query data in a database, providing a simple and standardized approach to data persistence and management.
