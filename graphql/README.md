# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need and provides a flexible and scalable way to access data in a consistent manner. 
It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in modern web development to improve performance and efficiency in data fetching and manipulation.
